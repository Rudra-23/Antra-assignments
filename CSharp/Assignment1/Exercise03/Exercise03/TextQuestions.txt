Answers:
1. It throws a DivideByZeroException.
2. Infinity or NaN.

4. x = y++; assigns y to x, then increment y by 1.
   x = ++y; increments y, then assigns it to x.
5. break exits the loop, continue skips to the next iteration, return exits the method.
6. initialization, condition, iteration; condition is required.
7. = is assignment, == checks equality.
8. Yes, It is an infinite loop.
