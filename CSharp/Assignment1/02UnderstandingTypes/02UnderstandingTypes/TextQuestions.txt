2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?

Value types store data directly, while reference types store memory addresses. Value types are stored on the stack, reference types on the heap. Ex. (int, float, double) vs (string, array)
Boxing converts a value type to an object (reference type), while unboxing extracts the value type from an object. 

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET

Managed resources in .NET are objects controlled by the Common Language Runtime (CLR), automatically handled for memory allocation and cleanup. 
Unmanaged resources are external to the CLR, like file handles or database connections, requiring explicit management and disposal by the programmer to prevent resource leaks.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?

The Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET automates memory management by:
1. Allocating objects on the managed heap
2. Reclaiming memory from unused objects
3. Freeing developers from manual memory management
